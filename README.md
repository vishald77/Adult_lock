# 🛡️ Adult Lock

Explainable fraud awareness system for adults.

## 🚩 Problem
Due to rise in onnline fraud for the elderly they are loosing huge amount of money, privacy and what not. We cannot monitor their phone all the time to be sure they accidently dont click on a malecious link which came via a message or an email. 

## 💡 Solution
Adult lock is a solution which without reading your message or emails, without asking for access permisions ask the users to paste the message and give them an indication of wheather the message is fraud or real.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Rule-based detection
- Risk scoring
- Human-readable explanation

## 🧠 Why Explainable AI?
Trust > accuracy in early-stage safety systems.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- ML integration
- Browser extension
- URL reputation checks
